# Outpost 10 Forward Chat Site Replica

## Description

When I was much younger, and still a relatively new fan to Star Trek, I stumbled upon a Star Trek chatroom. It was called Outpost 10 Forward, and was one of the preimminent scifi websites during the nineties and early 2000s. There, you could create an account in their Star Trek, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings realms and chat with other like fans. the site was so famous, they regularly had celebrities coming online to role play as famous Scifi characters.

It also offered unique features on their site. Every user had a rank, which they could improve with active participation and good behavior. Each rank increased your access to the site with more basic html and css, access to the armory(a site feature in itself which gave you the ability to protect the site from those who would try to abuse it), and webpages only availabe to certain ranks. As you increased in rank, you were also promoted to better site positions and given teams of other users to lead in improving the site itself.

It was because of this site that my initial interest in programming started. When I saw other users putting in html and css and creating pictures, and different colors in their chat messages I wanted to do that too. I wanted to help the website by making improvements to the code. However, I didn't know how. So I began learning.

## Additional

I built this site using jQuery and Backbone, and set up the back-end through the Parse.com server services, with styling done with SASS.
